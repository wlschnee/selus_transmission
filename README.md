# SELUS TRANSMISSION

Selus Transmission is a Ruby on Rails v5.0 blog CMS built for the (fictional) Selus Music Application.

This application is meant to be an exercise to demonstrate my ability to build a funcitonal CMS tool in a short time frame.

Currently there are no dependencies beyond Rails 5 and bcrypt.

Users are able to create accounts and create posts. Admins are a class of user able to edit and delete posts by any user.

#### Planend improvements
* Integrate a WYSIWYG text editor for rich text editing and image uploading
* Include Action Mailer routine to allow Admins to authorize new users
* CSS and appearance improvements
* Post sort and categorization improvements
