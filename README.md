# SELUS TRANSMISSION

Selus Transmission is a Ruby on Rails v5.0 blog CMS built for the (fictional) Selus Music Application.

This application is meant to be an exercise to demonstrate my ability to build a funcitonal CMS tool in a short time frame.

Currently there are no dependencies beyond Rails 5 and bcrypt, which provides functionality for user authentication.

Users are able to create accounts and create, edit and delete their own posts. Admins are a class of user able to edit and delete posts by any user, including their own, and able to assign or revoke admin privileges to other users.

The application uses the Bootsy gem for a rich text editing experience, so users can add formatting to their applications and link to images to include in their posts.
